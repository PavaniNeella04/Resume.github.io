            Plate Number using Yolo v2 and OCR Method</dt>
            <p><b>Project Description:</b></p>
        <dd>Nowadays, we come across various problems in traffic regulations in India which can be solved 
            with different ideas, Riding motorcycle without wearing helmet is a traffic violation which 
            leads to Increase in number of accidents and deaths in India.In this project we are detecting 
            whether two wheeler rider wearing helmet or not, if he is not wearing helmet then we are 
            extracting number plate of that two wheeler. The main principle involved is Object Detection 
            using Deep Learning at three levels. The objects detected are person, motorcycle at first level 
            using YOLOv2, helmet at second level using YOLOv3, license plate number at the last level 
            using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). </dd>
